        <h3>Does it hurt?</h3>
        <p>Most people compare the feeling of the needle to a mild bee sting. You will also be required to submit to a finger stick test each time you donate so the collection center medical staff can evaluate your protein and hemoglobin levels.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h3>Is donating plasma safe?</h3>
        <p>Yes. Plasma donation in IQPP certified collection centers is performed in a highly controlled, sterile environment by professionally trained medical staff. All plasma collection equipment is sterilized and any equipment that comes into contact with you is used only once to eliminate the possibility of transmitting viral infections.</p>

        <h3>What type of medical screening and testing is done?</h3>
        <p>You must have a pre-donation physical which includes answering medical history questions, tests for viruses such as HIV and Hepatitis and evaluating your protein and hemoglobin levels. For COVID-19 specific plasma, you need to have a positive antigen report not older than 15 days.</p>

        <h3>How do you get my plasma?</h3>
        <p>Donating plasma is similar to giving blood. A needle is placed into a vein in your arm. Plasma is collected through a process call plasmapheresis and is conducted in cycles that may take up to an hour. Whole blood is drawn. The plasma is separated from the red blood cells and other cellular components. These are returned to your body with sterile saline solution to help the body replace the plasma removed from the whole blood.</p>
    </div>

        <h3>How long does it take?</h3>
        <p>Your first donation will take approximately 2 hours. Return visits on average take about 90 minutes.</p>

        <h3>What do you do with my plasma?</h3>
        <p>Nearly 500 different types of proteins have been found in human blood plasma. Approximately 150 of these may be used for diagnosing disease or manufacturing therapies.</p>
